Swifty News (with REALM.io)
===========

**Swifty News** is a very simple app which consumes Hacker News rss feed. It entirely build with swift.

This project was updated from the original repository app [Swifty News](https://github.com/alikaragoz/Swifty-News), to illustrate how to use Realm.io, as part of the ProgrammableWeb article, titled [Getting Started with Realm for iOS](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/getting-started-realm-ios/how-to/2016/05/02).

Please note the code does not demonstrate best practices for RESTFul access, but a mere example of using [Realm](http://realm.io) with Swift to persist data easily.
